The file svn://svn/branches/<branch>/configuration/templateenvironment/gui.cfg is a build artifact that is used inside the application to control content of the swing menus. One menu in particular, the "Test Menu", is required for in-house builds, deployments to IMB servers tmrt-app, tmrt2-app and tmrv-app but NOT for the production deployment server tmrp-app.
To NOT display the test menu add an ant property gui_test_menu=false into the local.properties file for the appropriate environment of the particular build. This causes %GUI_TEST_MENU% in gui.cfg to be substituted with either an empty string (in the case of the build for tmrp-app) or the content of a file svn://svn/branches/<branch>/configuration/templateenvironment/gui_test_menu.txt that contains the test menu configuration.
{note}currently this property is ONLY set in the local.properties file for the environment quimby-production.{note}
