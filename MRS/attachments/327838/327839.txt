\*Starting and stopping jboss

h3. Eclipse

From your deployment menu \-> JBoss 4.x \-> Configure
Set optional program arguments to
*\-b your_ip_address*
Set optional shutdown arguments to
*\--shutdown your_ip_address*

h3. Solaris

{note:title=unix} Further research has been done on this so it is probably better not to edit jboss-service.xml but to provide parameters on run.sh or bat and shutdown.sh or bat
e.g for solaris
su - jboss \-c "/opt/jboss/bin/run.sh \-Djboss.bind.address=0.0.0.0 \-b 192.168.107.15" &
su - jboss \-c "/opt/jboss/bin/shutdown.sh \--shutdown \--server 192.168.107.15"
where the IP is the IP of the zone
With Windows for development the doco suggests that the IP could be replaced with a host name so your PC name could be used & should be resolved by DNS
