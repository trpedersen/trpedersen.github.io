Creating a database is fairly straightforward;

Run the highlighted text in your console window

# Remote desktop to pemsdb
# Open a command window
# Set the default database to mrs
{code:none}
set ORACLE_SID=MRS
{code}
# Export someone elses database (richard dazeley's shown here)
{code:none}
exp oraadmin/oraadmin owner=<exising user to copy>
{code}
# Run sqlplus (oracle commandline interface), as a privileged user
{code:none}
sqlplus / as sysdba
{code}
# Create a user for yourself (password is same as username)
{code:none}
create user _username_ identified by _username_
{code}
# Allow new user some capabilities
{code:none}
grant connect, resource, dba to _username_
{code}
# Exit sql plus
{code:none}
exit
{code}
# Import the (exported) database into your schema
{code:none}
imp _username_/_username_ fromuser=<user who was exported> touser=_username_
{code}
# Revoke dba from yourself
{code:none}
sqlplus / as sysdba
revoke dba from _username_
exit
{code}
# You are now done. Don't forget to log off from pemsdb
