Hudson is a fairly flexible continuous integration builder.
There are many plugins available for it on its website [http://hudson.javaforge.com].
The MRS installation is at [http://tmrd-build:8090/hudson/].

h2. General Do's and Dont's

* Do name the build according to convention. Don't change it.
* Do put your email address in the notify box
* Do make a new hudson job for each branch created. You make the branch, you set up the hudson job
* Do provide the adaptation in the job description field
* Do 'prepare for shutdown' hudson when playing with anything that could get in the way of a concurrently-executing builder
* Do 'prepare for shutdown' hudson when the server is going to be shutdown
* Don't delete builds
* Don't stop builds before they are finished *particularly if they are still checking out source*
* Don't change the settings without talking to either of the build managers.

h2. Important Build Targets
There are two build targets that are designed to be run from the integration build.  

* *full-build*: Cleans, compiles, runs tests
* *documentation-build*: Generates documentation 


h2. Configuring a New Builder
# From the main hudson page, select *New Job*
# Name the job, its prefrable that you name it as the build version. (ie something like 'branch-<branchname>'
# Choose *Copy existing job*
# and type the name of the trunk builder (MRS-Trunk at time of writing)
# Hit ok

Your builder has now been created, and you can customise the options for it with the current screen
* You can get back to this page by choosing selecting the job from the main page, and then clicking configure.

# Skip straight to the repository field
# Change the repository url to the one for your branch
# Leave the _Local module directory_ blank.
 This is a relative path specification as to where the source will be checked out into. 
# If a red message is displayed between the boxes about a PROPFIND request failing; You will need to set up authentication for the branch
## Click the enter credential link
## Choose basic authentication
## Enter *autobuild* for the username
## Enter *autobuild* for the password
## Use your browsers back button to return to the edit page
# There should not be any red text after the svn repository field
# Add a description to the job (top of the screen). Best practice is probably to copy&paste the adaptions to make into this field
# Append your email address to the _email recipients_ field. (you will always receive build messages if you are on this list)
# Make sure the _'dont send email for every broken build'_ box is checked
# Amend the artifacts list with the locations of any distributables generated
# Also amend the fingerprint field with the same information

If you require documentation to be generated also for your branch
# Create another hudson job
# Name it <name>-Documentation
# Copy the build settings from MRS-Trunk-Documentation
# Change the svn path to your build
# Make sure that your artifacts are specified 
# Make sure no emails are sent
# Make sure that jira issues are _not_ updated (otherwise you will see 'integrated in xxx-documentation' comments in jira- fairly useless)

*Now* add any jobs you have made to the relevant views, ie Trunk or Branches
Add code builders to the branches view
Add documentation generators to documentation view
Add trunk related stuff to trunk view

To add something to a particular view,
# Go to the desired view (ie click on the tab)
# Click the edit view link on the menu at the left
# Check the boxes for the jobs to show in this view

h2. Hudson Error Messages
h4. Svn checksum failed; expected=... got=null
Classic access denied message. Hudson runs under the (local) user hudson.
Run this from the command line on the server 
{code:none}
# chown tomcat:tomcat -R /data/hudson_home/
{code}

h2. Tips
h3. Memory allocation
*If your build needs more memory:
{code:none}
  -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
{code}
This will set the memory ceiling to a gig, and give the permanent generation size (ie used for reflection etc) to 256meg

* On your local box set the environment variable ANT_OPTS to something like the above 
*# Go to hudson -> (your project) -> configure
*# Click the *advanced* button, and enter the above memory options in the box presented
* Note that Calls to the ant macro _run-ant-build_ will spawn and have their *own* memory allocation (ie defaults). If you need to increase the memory for something that is called after this macro being used, check out the macros.xml file 

h3. Temporarily stopping building
If you are executing any targets that could affect the build process, you should consider halting the builds until you finish.
* Things like
** svn cleanups / folder trickery from /hudson_home/jobs/.../actrego
** Database dropping/population for the building users
# From hudson, go to Manage
# Click the prepare shutdown link
Builds will now not run, and the hudson configuration (should be) saved to disk
# Do whatever youd like
# When finished, go back to the manage page, and click the cancel shutdown link (where the shutdown link was)
#* You can also cancel the shutdown by clicking the cancel link from the build queue.

*If tomcat is going to go down, hit the shutdown link to be sure all the configuration survives.
